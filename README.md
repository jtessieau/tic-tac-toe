# TIC TAC TOE

## Programming Language

Vanilla JS. No framework or library. This code can run in your navigator by opening `index.html`.

## Purpose

Reuse the notions learned by coding the dice game to do a simple version of this game using javascript OOP. Deals with the boundaries of the `this` keyword.
